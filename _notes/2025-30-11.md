# Linear transformations
Something about matrices etc. bases, change of co-ordinates etc etc.

# The determinant
A matrix can be used to change from one co-ordinate system to another. However, we would like to know how shapes in co-ordinate system A will be changed when transformed to co-ordinate system B. If we focus on one shape in particular, the unit n-cube, then we can see how the volume changes after we apply our linear transformation by examining the determinant of the matrix in question.

The determinant can be calculated by taking the product of each of the eigenvalues of our matrix. The volume of a unit $n$-cube is calculated by taking the length of its side to the power of $n$. The eigenvalues also tell us how much the corresponding eigenvector is scaled after applying our matrix.
